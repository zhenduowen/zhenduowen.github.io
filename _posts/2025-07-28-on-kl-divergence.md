TODO: 
Statistics:
- Stein's lemma, relates KL Divergence with Type II error exponent

- Donsker-Varadhen variational representation of KL divergence
- Golden formula for mutual information, Eq 8.7 in Information Theory: coding theorems for discrete memoryless systems

Information geometry and projection:
- Sanov Theorem

_ Also, some basic arithmetics
